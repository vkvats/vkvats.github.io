I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/). I work in [Computer Vision Lab](http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/) with [Prof. David Crandall](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/djcran/). I am majoring in [Computer Science](https://cs.indiana.edu/) with a minor in Machine Learning. Before joining the Ph.D. program, I earned a master's degree in [Data Science](https://datascience.indiana.edu/programs/residential/index.html) at Indiana University with a thesis on ['Response-Based Knowledge Distillation'](https://vkvats.github.io/files/Vkvats_master_thesis.pdf). I completed a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at the National Institute of Technology, Patna [(NITP)](http://www.nitp.ac.in/php/home.php).

Research Interests
------
My research involves developing and applying computer vision algorithms that understand, analyze, and organize large-scale datasets of images and video using deep learning-based techniques. My recent focus has been on creating computer vision algorithms that can generate and synthesize 3D models of visual scenes from 2D images, using techniques such as multi-view stereo, stable diffusion, and other deep learning models

* 3D reconstruction with learning-based Multi-View Stereo
* Geometrical reasoning of 3D scenes
* Deep Learning and Case-Based Reasoning (DL-CBR) integration
* Deep Learning - Architectural understanding and exploration
* Generative models for geospatial images

Teaching
------

I co-teach Computer Vision (CSCI-B 657) with my advisor every Spring since 2022. I discuss a number of seminal papers exploring deep learning (DL) architectures. I designed the first iteration of the DL discussion section in Spring 2022, it is designed to explore the seminal papers exploring DL architectures to develop an intuitive as well as mathematical understanding of major concepts in DL. In 16 weeks, the course roughly covers major architectures in three broad sections, Convolution-based networks (CNNs), Multi-layer perceptron-based networks (MLPs), and Transformer-based networks (ViTs). In CNNs, we cover models like LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, ResNets, Wide ResNet, Stochastic ResNet, ResNeXt, DenseNet, ConvMixer, and Xception Net. In MLPs, we cover models like MLP Mixer, ResMLP, cycleMLP, and S^2 MLP model, and in ViTs, we cover models like Vision Transformer, DeiT, Swin Transformer, Local ViT, Convolutional-ViT, etc. We also explore shift operation-based networks. The class meets weekly with more than 150 students participating in the discussion. The list of papers covered in the discussion is below

Fun
------
I run for fun :). Find me on the Nike Run Club (@Vibhas_Vats). Hiking, driving, reading, and writing are calming things to do.
