About me
------

I am first year Ph.D. student at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/). I work in [Computer Vision Lab](http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/) with [Prof. David Crandall](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/djcran/). I am majoring in [Computer Science](https://cs.indiana.edu/) with minor is Computer Science. Before joining Ph.D. program, I earned master's degree in [Data Science](https://datascience.indiana.edu/programs/residential/index.html) at Indiana University. My master's thesis is on ['Response-Based Knowledge Distillation'](https://vkvats.github.io/files/Vkvats_master_thesis.pdf). I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at National Institute of Technology, Patna [(NITP)](http://www.nitp.ac.in/php/home.php). [(Résumé)](https://vkvats.github.io/files/VibhasVats-resume-public.pdf).  

Research Interests
------

* Deep Learning - Architectural understanding and exploration 
* 3D reconstruction with DL techniques
* Image Segmentation 
* Uses of Deep Learning techniques with Case-Based Reasoning methods (DL-CBR)

Teaching
------

In spring 2022, I designed and was the instructor for the first iteration of 'Computer Vision - paper discussion section' at Indiana University. The course was designed to explore seminal papers about different architectures in recent history of deep-learning and computer vision.  The course traced the history of development of Convolutional Neural Networks (like, LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, ResNets, Wide ResNet, Stochastic ResNet, ResNeXt, DenseNet, ConvMixer, Xception Net, etc.), Multi-layer Perceptron based networks (like, MLP Mixer, ResMLP, cycleMLP and S^2 MLP model), Transformer based Networks for vision application like, Vision Transformer, Deit, Swin Transformer, Local ViT, CvT etc. papers) and other important architectures like SAN (self-attention Network), shift-based papers etc. The class met weekly with more than 130 students taking part in discussion. Check discussion schedule and slides for more details.
