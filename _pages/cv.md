Research Experience
------
* **Research Assistant**, Indiana University Computer Vision lab                                                                         
  * Deep Learning (DL) - Case Based Reasoning (CBR) survey paper: June 2020 – Present
    * Collaborated with DL-CBR research group in writing two sections of the survey paper- retrieval and DL models with memory.
  * Exploring Accuracy and Explainability of DL-CBR Hybrid Architectures: Jan 2022 – Present
    * Exploring hybrid system leveraging knowledge-engineered and network learned feature in concert.
    * Analyzing different DL architectures to study the impact of learned features in the DL-CBR hybrid system.
  * Multi-View Stereo (MVS) Method for High-resolution Depth-map Prediction and Point Cloud Generation: Aug 2021 – Present
    * Improving the application of MVS algorithm for high-resolution depth map prediction
    * Applying MVS algorithm at multiple stages of DL architecture to improve the accuracy and completeness of 3D point cloud
