Abstract: Stereophotogrammetry is an emerging technique of scene understanding. 
Its origins go back to at least the 1800s when people first started to investigate 
using photographs to measure the physical properties of the world. Since then, thousands 
of approaches have been explored. The classic geometric techniques of Shape from Stereo 
is built on using geometry to define constraints on scene and camera geometry and then
solving the non-linear systems of equations. More recent work has taken an entirely 
different approach, using end-to-end deep learning without any attempt to explicitly 
model the geometry. In this survey, we explore the overlap for geometric-based and deep 
learning-based frameworks. We compare and contrast geometry enforcing constraints 
integrated into a deep learning framework for depth estimation or other closely related 
problems. We present a new taxonomy for prevalent geometry enforcing constraints used 
in modern deep learning frameworks. We also present insightful observations and potential future research directions.
