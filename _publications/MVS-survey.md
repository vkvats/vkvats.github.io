Abstract: Stereophotogrammetry is an established technique for scene understanding. 
    Its origins go back to at least the 1800s when people first started to investigate 
    using photographs to measure the physical properties of the world. 
    Since then, thousands of approaches have been explored. 
    The classic geometric technique of Shape from Stereo is 
    built on using geometry to define constraints on scene and camera
    deep learning without any attempt to explicitly model the geometry. 
    In this survey, we explore geometry-inspired deep learning-based frameworks. 
    We compare and contrast geometry enforcing constraints integrated 
    into deep learning frameworks for depth estimation and other closely 
    related vision tasks. We present a new taxonomy for prevalent 
    geometry enforcing constraints used in modern deep learning frameworks. 
    We also present insightful observations and potential future research directions.
