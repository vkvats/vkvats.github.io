Abstract: Reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of a scene is 
a classic and fundamental problem in computer vision, but it has been 
revolutionized by recent progress in deep machine learning. In this paper, 
we survey this rich and growing area. We divide the work into four main 
threads: 3d reconstruction from two calibrated images from a binocular 
camera; 3d reconstruction from more than two images taken by the same 
camera or more than two calibrated cameras; object-focused 3D reconstruction 
with relaxed camera calibration; and SLAM-based techniques. We summarize each 
approach along five salient dimensions: algorithmic and deep network characteristics, 
output representation, datasets, and quantitative comparisons among different
methods. We also discuss key challenges and future directions.
