In spring 2023, I taught the second iteration of the 'Computer Vision - discussion section' at Indiana University. The course was designed to explore the seminal papers on different architectures of deep learning and computer vision.  The course traced the history of the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (like, LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, ResNets, Wide ResNet, Stochastic ResNet, ResNeXt, DenseNet, ConvMixer, Xception Net, etc.), Multi-layer Perceptron based networks (like, MLP Mixer, ResMLP, cycleMLP, and S^2 MLP model), Transformer based Networks for vision application like Vision Transformer, DeiT, Swin Transformer, Local ViT, CvT etc. papers) and other important architectures like SAN (self-attention Network), shift-based papers etc. The class met weekly with more than 130 students participating in the discussion. Please take a look at the discussion schedule and slides for more details.
